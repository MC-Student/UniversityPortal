- Create initial UI for logged-in student with 3 tabs (using TabControl?)
- Review requirements for each tab in student app using [List of reports/apps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iLkEf6UJe8XEaxrWop2d4ez3JVAtTNC-8GSqJSv3daE/edit?usp=sharing  "List of reports as of Dec 14")
- Each member of team will branch off to work on assigned tab and create PR on first push
  - `git checkout -b studentInfoTab`
  - `git checkout -b studentCourseTab`
  - `git checkout -b studentGradeTab`
- Determine due dates for each PR to be merged into main (each one can be merged as soon as done and everyone else will pull from main to their branch if still open)
